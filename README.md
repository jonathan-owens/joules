# Intro

*joules (JOnathan's UtiLitiES)* is a Python package that provides various 
basic functionality that I tend to use across projects.

This is a **major** work-in-progress as I work on finding and putting 
together all similar Python utilities I have written over the years.

The main idea is to collect common functionality, building up this module as 
needed for contemporary work, while ensuring new additions have proper 
documentation and testing.
